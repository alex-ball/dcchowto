# dcchowto: A LaTeX class for DCC How-to Guides

This class is useful for typesetting DCC How-to Guides. It comes with some
support files to make it possible to generate camera-ready copy from Markdown
source. The Markdown could then be used to generate an HTML version as well.

## Installation

### Automated way

A makefile is provided which you can use with the Make utility:

  * Running `make` generates the derived files README, dcchowto.pdf and dcchowto.cls.
  * Running `make inst` installs the files in the user's TeX tree.
  * Running `make install` installs the files in the local TeX tree.
